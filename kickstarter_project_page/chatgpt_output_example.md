# 🎯 Growth Hack: Search Intent Analysis

## Goal
To understand **what searchers actually want** when they type your target keywords into Google — and then align your website’s content and structure with that intent so it ranks higher and satisfies users better.

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **List Your Target Keywords**
Start with your **most important SEO keywords or phrases** — the ones your ideal audience would use when looking for your product, service, or information.

**Examples:**
- “best CRM for startups”
- “growth hacking strategies”
- “how to improve website conversion rate”

---

### 2. **Search Each Keyword in Google**
Perform a **manual Google search** for each target keyword (in incognito mode or logged out to avoid personalization).

**Observe the top 10–20 results:**
- What type of content ranks (blog posts, product pages, videos, comparison lists, etc.)?
- What are the titles and structures?
- What topics or angles appear repeatedly?

---

### 3. **Identify the Search Intent**
Now classify each keyword according to the **type of intent** Google seems to be favoring. The main categories:

| Intent Type | Description | Example Query |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Informational** | User wants to learn something | “how to build backlinks” |
| **Navigational** | User wants a specific site or brand | “Ahrefs login” |
| **Transactional** | User wants to buy or take action | “buy SEO course” |
| **Commercial Investigation** | User comparing options before purchase | “best SEO tools 2025” |

💡 *Hint:* Look at the wording of ranking titles — “Top 10,” “Guide,” “vs.,” or “Buy” often signal different intents.

### 4. **Find the Intersection: User Intent vs Google Intent**
Here’s the clever bit — your **user’s intent** might differ from what Google rewards right now.  
You want to find **the overlap** between:
- What your ideal audience truly wants when searching this term, and
- What Google is currently ranking and rewarding.

**Example:**
- Your keyword: “email marketing automation”  
- You think users want a **tool** (transactional),  
- But Google’s top results are **guides** (“What is email automation?”) — informational.

✅ **Action:** Create a hybrid content piece — an “Email Automation Guide” that includes tutorials **and** subtle product demos.

---

### 5. **Optimize or Create Content Accordingly**
Once you’ve mapped the intent:
- **Rewrite titles, intros, and CTAs** to better match that search intent.
- **Structure your content** like the top-ranking pages (use H2s, FAQs, lists, etc.).
- Add or remove content types (e.g., video summaries, product comparisons) to align with intent.
- Update your internal links to reinforce that intent.
